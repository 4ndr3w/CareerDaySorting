<li>A webserver able to execute PHP files</li>
<li>PHP with the MySQL extention</li>
<li>A MySQL Database</li>
</ul><p>Installation instructions:</p>

</ol><h3>Suggested Workflow</h3>

<p>This is the suggested workflow for running CareerDaySorter:</p>

<ol>
<li>Construct a list of careers in an Excel document, using the format specified in importCareers.php</li>
<li>Export the career list as a CSV and import it to CareerDaySorter using importCareers.php</li>
<li>Ensure all data was proporly imported</li>
<li>Distribute the link to index.php or signup.php to teachers/students</li>
<li>AFTER all students have signed up, go to the admin page and run an automatic sort</li>
<li>Manually resolve any students that can't be automaticlly sorted</li>
<li>Print student schedules and career attendance lists ( or save as PDF )</li>
</ol><h3>Hidden Careers</h3>

<p>"Careers" such as the class assembly and career shadowing exist as hidden careers inside the database. A hidden career does not appear in the signup list for students.
If you did not import using the structure file, you will need to manually insert the row for these events and set their ID in config.php</p>

<p>By default, Assembly has an ID of 999 and Career Shadowing/College Visit has an ID of 998.</p>
